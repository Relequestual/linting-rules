# API Lifecycle
This is a proof of concept to see how we can define the API lifecycle in a modular and flexible enough way that anyone can define their own version of the API lifecycle using a common set of elements and actions. This runs on Github, and everything is defined using YAML, allowing it to be forked and worked on collaboratively, using Github issues to evolve and iterate upon the repository of API lifecycle blueprints, elements, and actions.
